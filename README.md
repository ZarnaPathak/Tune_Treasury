# Tune_Treasury 🎶
  Tune Treasury is a Song List Management System designed to learn the MERN stack. It features APIs built with Express.js for adding, updating, and deleting songs, and uses MongoDB (Atlas) 
  for data storage. The React frontend is connected to the backend via Axios for seamless API calls. This project provided hands-on experience with CRUD operations and the MERN stack.
